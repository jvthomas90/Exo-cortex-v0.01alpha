# Exo-cortex-v0.01alpha
Clever text-editor. Externalize your cerebral-cortex!

## About
Exo-cortex is (ideally) an “external” cortex to complement/supplement the cerebral cortex inside your skull. As the functions of the latter plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness, the former is meant to work in tandem with your mental processes in order to help boost your creativity, interconnect and surface related concepts, facilitate a higher quality and/or quantity of ideation throughput from conception to creation, and overall help offload your “mental RAM” (so-to-speak) onto a trusted external system to aid you in becoming a more confident and cognizant individual.

### Usage and Dev-notes
Currently, the alpha-version of this software is fairly simple. I was only aiming to make a basic CLI tool to review or update notes... granted, I did want to do some interesting things with the "review" part in the way of color-coded and italicized/emphacized/etc font-styling when certain @tags are recognized that signify due times or priority items. 

Nonetheless, functionally speaking, the alpha version works - one can use this tool to offload thoughts, ideas, notes and tasks onto an "external brain" that you can refer to for review at a later time. There is even some clever logic going on when it comes to erroneous user-input to expected program flow, and even a little bit of recursive function calls as well (I'm particularly proud of that considering CS 1.0 didn't cover recursion yet ^^).

Future updates to the beta builds ***WILL*** improve the regex recognition and formatting of @tagged items in exocortex.txt. Till then, enjoy this functionally monochromatic mess that is the `RemoteAccessMemory` module of my burgeoning Exocortex.txt based todo-list.application :)
